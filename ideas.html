			As a student participating in this project, you'll learn about the automatic composition of Java source files using
			Annotation processing. You'll use libraries like Square's JavaPoet to build tools that write code for developers,
			automating tasks that can be predicted and standardized ahead of time.</p>			 
		    	<p class="project-description">
			Project Idea 1: Blueprint uses Annotation Processing to dynamically write new source code, which automates 
			the creation of the boilerplate associated with Android RecyclerViews.  Students will expand this capability,
			using Annotation Processing to create even more functionality to make the task of build apps evenb easier for 
			developers using Blueprint.</p>
	    		<p class="project-description">
			Project idea 2: Students on this project will help us convert the entire codebase to Kotlin.  Google has recently
			endorsed Kotlin as a supported language for Android Application Development, so we'll convert both our sample App
			and library tools to use the Kotlin programming language.</p>
			<p class="project-description">
			Project Idea 3: Students will work to create templates for common tasks facing developers using Blueprint.  Students will
			help design standard base classes for Activities and Fragments that Blueprint devs can use to jump start the creation of
			Blueprint apps.
			  </p>
			<p class="project-description">
			Project Idea 4: Students will expand Blueprint to allw devs to create apps using a Grid,  rather than a single column 
			list.  Students will build functionality and samples of how to use Blueprint to add components to screens in multiple 
			columns, and develop optional custom animations for adding, removing, and changing components.

                         support to Bynar.  This would greatly expand the situations where Bynar can be used.

						<b>Project idea 2.</b>  On storage servers you generally have raid controllers installed.  
						While these controllers are helpful in managing storage drives they also create a problem.
						Tools such as smartmon, libatasmart, etc do not always interact well with raid controllers.
						The raid controllers expose information about the backing storage drives in their own
						way with their own command line interface.  The goal of this project would be to teach
						Bynar how to interact with a few major raid controllers thus giving it more accurate
						information to work under.  This project will require some research on how 
						raid controllers work before being started.

						<b>Project idea 3.</b>  This is the hardest project but also possibly the most interesting!
						Hard drives expose a variety of information
						about their status.  The goal of this project would be to use artificial intelligence
						to make accurate predictions about when a hard drive might die.  There have been papers
						written about this that are floating around the internet.  Predictions from smart are 
						generally not very accurate but AI predictions are proving very accurate. 80-90% accurate
						to within a few days of when a drive will die.  This project may will require reading of PhD
						papers, independent research on hard drive failure scenarios and machine learning.

			Bynar builds upon many years of experience automating the drudgery of server repair.
